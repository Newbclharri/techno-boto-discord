"Hello World"
Hi Tim, if you see this, I'm just practicing how to work with git Worflow.  Thanks for all your help.

About me:
I've been programming off and on for years, but never made it to the next level by using all of the extra tools it takes to actually make something. I never got past using text editors in IDE's. I would create a program on my system and it would never see anything other than the native terminal.  

At age 36 I'm finally trying to get over my anxiety and fear of failure. I know failure is how we learn, but I guess may fears encompassed more than a single identefier.  I feared I wouldn't be able to find a job doing something I always wanted to do which, in my mind, would spiral into continues life failures everwhere else.  Now, I'm being consistent. I'm ready to make a change.

I appreciate your resources.  Have a good one, man!
